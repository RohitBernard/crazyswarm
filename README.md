# Gesture Controlled Swarm
Gesture Controlled Swarm is an individual project for the course CSCI 599 - Holodecks at USC.

Gesture Controlled Swarm uses drones to render a simple 3D point cloud which can be controlled and manipulated by a user' hand gestures. The project is built upon USC ACT lab's Crazyswarm which defines a Python API to track and control a swarm of Crazyflie 2.0 miniature quadcopters.

The Python script for the Gesture Controlled Swarm can be found at: [ros_ws/src/crazyswarm/scripts/gesture_controlled_swarm.py](ros_ws/src/crazyswarm/scripts/gesture_controlled_swarm.py)

## Troubleshooting
Please start a [Discussion](https://github.com/USC-ACTLab/crazyswarm/discussions) for...

- Getting Crazyswarm to work with your hardware setup.
- Advice on how to use the [Crazyswarm Python API](https://crazyswarm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) to achieve your goals.
- Rough ideas for a new feature.

Please open an [Issue](https://github.com/USC-ACTLab/crazyswarm/issues) if you believe that fixing your problem will involve a **change in the Crazyswarm source code**, rather than your own configuration files. For example...

- Bug reports.
- New feature proposals with details.
